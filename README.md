# NimbleMVC DEMO APPLICATION

**NimbleMVC PHP Framework** is a small, fully featured, fast framework developed entirely from scratch that follows the famous **Model-View-Controller** architecture.

This is a demo blogging app created with **NimbleMVC PHP framework** by me.
The framework itself can be found in my [nimblemvc](https://github.com/farhanhasinc/nimblemvc) repo. 
You can have a look at the code of this demo to learn more about the framework as the doc at it's current state is pretty horrible :unamused:
