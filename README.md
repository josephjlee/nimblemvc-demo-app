# DIYMVC DEMO APPLICATION

**DIYMVC PHP framework (or boilerplate, call it the way you want to)** is a small framework that follows the famous **Model-View-Controller** architecture.

This is a demo blogging app created with **DIYMVC PHP framework** by me.
The framework itself can be found in my [diymvc](https://github.com/farhanhasinc/diymvc) repo. 
You can have a look at the code of this demo to learn more about the framework as the doc at it's current state is pretty horrible :unamused:
